		<h2>(Sticker) Print Design</h2>
		<h1>WALKING CROWS</h1>
		<p>As a designer with a passion for the outdoors, I focus a lot of my work on promoting practices that make for a healthier planet. This project allowed me to be more playful with my art while experimenting with the style of messaging I chose to use. It gave me the freedom to share my ideas in a way I felt emboldened.</p>

		<h2>Branding and Web Design</h2>
		<h1>POWER OF EDUCATION</h1>
		<p><a href="https://power-of-edu.org/">Power of Education</a> is a non profit organization committed to provide support, guidance, and financial backing to select children in underpriveleged communities. Their values of community, excellence, and education were my focal points throughout the logo design process.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>As I shifted to designing and coding the website, I reiterated their values while focusing on the user experience by structuring the layout to guide users intuitively. Bold colors, strong callouts and deliberate image placement remind viewers of the nonprofit's message of making change in the lives of children. Every design decision was made to create something functional, intentional, and imactful.</p>

		<h2>(Packaging) Print Design</h2>
		<h1>OLLY GUMMIES</h1>
		<p>This design project, in which I chose to redesign OLLY Gummies' packaging, encouraged creative typography and out-of-the box imagery, keeping in mind the messages they share and the audiences they reach. This <em>school project</em> allowed students to be experimental with color, design and typography while working with a unique packaging shape.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My choice of the rounded text, soft monochromatic colors, and the unique wavy cloud pattern that circles this package design are all features that reinforce buyers of OLLY's product: melatonin (sleep) gummies. A unique cutout on the side of the box following the shape of the clouds adds another visually alluring detail. The overall design of this package provides a sense of uniqueness and draw that nudges consumers to buy OLLY products.</p>

<!-- FOR BOOKWORKS <p>This rebrand experimented with Figma and was used to understand and expand on text hierarchies when designing websites to fit the ever growing need to mobile compatible sites. Though it was never coded, I believe this project highlights my eye for design.
