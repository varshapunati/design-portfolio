		<p>Dear Reader,</p>
		<p>Welcome, my name is Varsha Punati. A quick introduction about me, <em>I am and always have been a creative</em>. My creative avenues stretch from graphic design to classical dance to photography. I have always felt a draw towards the arts. And with that draw to art came a desire to perfect my own work. Graphic design is ones of my few high risk, high reward hobbies, and with my time at CSU Monterey Bay, I have been lucky enough to expand that into a career. Through <em>hours of experimental passion</em> and through the <em>kindness of my many professors</em> I have had the ability to hone my skills across various design applications, including, but not limited to Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, as well as Figma. I have also worked with many website hosting platforms and have mastered web design. My full trajectory as a designer has been highlighted in my <a href="resume-web.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Apart from the creative lanes of graphic design, I am a passionate outdoorsman. I grew up fortunate enough to explore many of the world's beauties. In 2019 I <em>summited Mt. Kilimanjaro</em> and thus began my mountain climbing journey. I have since trekked Everest Base Camp, Mont Blanc, climbed El Capitan, Half Dome, and Mt. Dana, as well asMt. Whitney. I continue to search for peaks to climb and one day hope to scale the Seven Summits. Through my mountain climbing I have gained many lifeskills including <em>leadership</em>, <em>cooperation</em>, and <em>perseverance</em>, which help me on the slopes but also in my professional life. I share a more in depth analysis of my experiences in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/varsha_punati_of_mountains_and_men_a_story_of_summiting_resilience?subtitle=en">my TEDx Talk</a>.</p>
